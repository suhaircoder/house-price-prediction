# House Price Prediction Project

I built a machine learning model to predict house prices with excellent accuracy.

## Results
- 96.9% of predictions within $20,000 of actual prices
- Average error: $4,881 per house
- Best model: Random Forest

## How I Built It
1. Cleaned the data and handled missing values
2. Created smart features like Total Square Feet
3. Trained multiple machine learning models
4. Achieved professional-level accuracy

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas for data analysis
- scikit-learn for machine learning
- matplotlib for visualizations
